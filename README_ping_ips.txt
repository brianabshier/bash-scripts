IP Ping Checker

This Bash script reads a list of IP addresses from a file named "ip_list.txt", pings each IP address five times, and prints the ping results.

Usage:
1. Ensure the "ip_list.txt" file contains a list of IP addresses, each on a separate line.
2. Run the script using the following command:

./ping_checker.sh

Note: Ensure that the script has executable permissions (`chmod +x ping_checker.sh`) before running it.
